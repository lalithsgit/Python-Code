1. Collatz Conjecture - Start with a number n > 1. Find the number of steps it takes to reach one using the following process: If n is even, divide it by 2. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.

1. Coin Flip Simulation - Write some code that simulates flipping a single coin however many times the user decides. The code should record the outcomes and count the number of tails and heads.

1. Country from IP Lookup - Enter an IP address and find the country that IP is registered in. Optional: Find the Ip automatically.

1. Shape Area and Perimeter Classes - Create an abstract class called Shape and then inherit from it other shapes like diamond, square, circle, triangle etc. Then have each class override the area and perimeter functionality to handle each shape type.

1. Security Caesar cipher - Implement a Caesar cipher, both encoding and decoding. The key is an integer from 1 to 25. This cipher rotates the letters of the alphabet (A to Z). The encoding replaces each letter with the 1st to 25th next letter in the alphabet (wrapping Z to A). So key 2 encrypts "HI" to "JK", but key 20 encrypts "HI" to "BC". This simple "monoalphabetic substitution cipher" provides almost no security, because an attacker who has the encoded message can either use frequency analysis to guess the key, or just try all 25 keys

1. Page Scraper - Create an application which connects to a site and pulls out all links, or images, and saves them to a list. Optional: Organize the indexed content and donâ€™t allow duplicates. Have it put the results into an easily searchable index file.
